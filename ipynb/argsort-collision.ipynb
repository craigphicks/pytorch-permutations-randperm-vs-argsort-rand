    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The PyTorch library, widely used for neural networks on a GPU, supplies a function `torch.randperm(length)` that returns a permutation in a one-dimensional tensor, e.g.,\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> torch.randperm(6)\n",
    "tensor([5, 3, 2, 4, 0, 1])\n",
    "```\n",
    "However, `torch.randperm` has a drawback - it cannot produce multiple permutations in batch mode. In PyTorch, batch mode refers to processing multiple inputs simultaneously, which improves performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar result can be obtained by using `torch.argsort` with `torch.rand` or `torch.randint`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> torch.argsort(torch.rand(6))\n",
    "tensor([4, 3, 2, 5, 0, 1])\n",
    "```\n",
    "Unlike `torch.randperm`, `torch.argsort` with `torch.rand` or `torch.randint` can be used to produce a multidimensional tensor of permutations:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create a batch of 3 permutations of length 6\n",
    ">>> torch.argsort(torch.rand(3, 6))\n",
    "tensor([[4, 3, 2, 5, 0, 1],\n",
    "        [2, 5, 1, 0, 3, 4],\n",
    "        [0, 3, 1, 5, 2, 4]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference in speed becomes significant when utilizing a GPU to process tensors in parallel in a batch call, which may be faster per permutation by orders of magnitude. However, if there is no need to create multiple permutations or no need for speed, then using `randperm` is sufficient.\n",

    "## 2. Bias in Permutations Generated by `torch.argsort` with `torch.rand`\n",
    "\n",
    "How does `torch.randperm` differ from and perform better than `torch.argsort(torch.rand...)`?\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue is that among the arrays of random numbers produced by `torch.rand` and `torch.randint` are arrays that include duplicate numbers (also known as collisions). That, in turn, biases the distribution of permutations produced by sorting those arrays with `torch.sort`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> a = torch.randint(low=10, high=16, size=(6,))\n",
    "tensor([11, 12, 15, 12, 11, 10])\n",
    ">>> torch.sort(a, stable=True)\n",
    "torch.return_types.sort(\n",
    "values=tensor([10, 11, 11, 12, 12, 15]),\n",
    "indices=tensor([5, 0, 4, 1, 3, 2]))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, the value of the parameter range `high - low` was set artificially low to 6 to induce duplicate values to be sorted. As a result, the sorted indices `0, 4`, corresponding to the duplicate sorted values `11, 11`, are arranged in ascending order (guaranteed by a stable sort, which maintains the relative order of equal elements). Likewise, indices `1, 3` are in ascending order. The resulting distribution of sorted indices is not symmetric because it is biased to have more ascending pairs than descending pairs, as a result of duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the function `torch.randperm` is written to detect any duplicate keys and partially recalculate the results to remove the effects of those duplicate keys. The recalculation consists of regenerating keys for, and resorting only, those intervals with compromised values after the initial sort is complete. The result is almost perfect (excepting the tiny chance of the regenerated keys also having duplicates - it doesn't use a loop to eliminate that possibility). By using `torch.randperm`, the possibility of a biased distribution is (almost) eliminated.\n",

    "## 3. Cost Criteria for Collisions when Using `argsort` with Randomly Generated Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The user generating multiple permutations of length $K$ must decide which form to use:\n",
    "- A batch of permutations capable call to `argsort(rand...(batch_count, K))` which may have a biased result.\n",
    "- Multiple single permutation only calls to `randperm(K)` which is (almost) unbiased.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the batch capable call may be any of these three forms:\n",
    "- `argsort(rand(batch_count, K))` where the `rand` call returns values of type `torch.float32`, and uses a 24-bit random number generator.\n",
    "- `argsort(randint(low=-2**31, high=2**31-1, (batch_count, K), dtype=torch.integer32)` where the `randint` call returns values of type `torch.integer32` and uses a 32-bit random number generator (\\*1).\n",
    "- `argsort(randint(low=-2**63, high=2**63-1, (batch_count, K), dtype=torch.integer64)` where the `randint` call returns values of type `torch.integer64` and uses a 64-bit random number generator (\\*1).\n",
    "\n",
    "> *\\* Note 1: The PyTorch documentation for `randint` parameters says \"high (int) – One above the highest integer to be drawn from the distribution.\" Therefore, we would expect the setting `high=2**31` to be appropriate. However, this has been found to lead to errors in some PyTorch versions.*\n",
    "\n",
    "As will be shown, a higher number of bits in the random number generator will produce a less biased distribution of permutations. On the other hand, the `integer64` bit version uses twice the memory as the `integer32` bit version, allowing for less parallelization and thus being slower. Both `float32` and `integer32` use the same amount of memory, but the `rand()` form of the call has been anecdotally seen to be a few percent faster than `randint()` with `integer32` form, although this may vary by system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document will define a family of criteria $P_{\\text{crit}}(K;m, N)$ that can be used to determine whether a particular length $K$ and random bits $m$ will have too many collisions, or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $K$ is the permutation length, fixed with respect to the decision rule,\n",
    "- $m \\in \\{24, 32, 64\\}$ corresponds to the three forms of calling random number generation shown above. \n",
    "- $N$ is free parameter for $P_{\\text{crit}}(K; m, N)$, set per application depending on how risk/benefit is calculated.  A value of $N=1$ means risk/benefit is calculated independently per permutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistical measure $P_{\\text{crit}}(K; m, N)$ is defined such that given a random permutation generated by either `randperm(K)` or `torch.argsort(torch.rand(K))` with a 50% chance of each method being used, but without knowing which method was used. $P_{\\text{crit}}(K; m, N)$ is the probability of guessing correctly which distribution the sample was drawn from, using an optimal guessing strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then constrain the value of $P_{\\text{crit}} < C_{\\text{thresh}}$ to define our desired risk model. For example, setting $P_{\\text{crit}} < 0.55$ means we would be able to correctly guess whether a permutation came from the fair or biased distribution 11 out of 20 times, or 55% percent of the time. The mathematical range of $P_{\\text{crit}}$ is between $0.5$ and $1$, corresponding to 50% to 100%. However, we will only consider the range $0.50$ to $0.55$, because beyond that the model loses accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Section [\"Modeling Sorted Collisions as a Binomial of Coin Tosses with a Biased Coin\"](#coin-toss-binomial) shows how the fair and biased distributions of permutations length $K$ can be modelled using a binomial distribution of $K$ coins tosses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Section [\"Best Guess Criterion: Single Set of K Tosses\"](#best-guess-criterion-single) introduces the model for $P_{\\text{crit}}(K; m, N)$, with $N=1$, as described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Section [\"Best Guess Criterion: N Sets of K Tosses\"](#best-guess-criterion-multi) adds another parameter, $N$, to give $P_{\\text{crit}}(K;m,N)$, where $N>=1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "An obvious question is: *Why model a single permutation (i.e. $N=1$) when the whole reason to use `argsort` with `random` instead of `randperm` is the advantage of batch production of permutations?*\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is that even in such cases, it may be the cost/benefit ratio per single permutation that is relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The canonical counter-example would be, of course, the application of calculating the exact cost criterion over $N$ permutations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, $N$ serves as another free parameter (in addition to $C_{\\text{thresh}}$) that can be set appropriately per application.\n",

    "Consider the output of a call of torch.randperm(), assuming that it is a perfectly unbiased result. Because the indices in the result are unique, each adjacent pair is either ascending or descending. For our model, we will wrap the vector and count element pair $[K-1, 0]$ of the result as another pair, so that the number of adjacent pairs is $K$.

    "\n",
    "In this document, we explored the differences between `torch.randperm` and `torch.argsort` with `torch.rand` or `torch.randint` for generating permutations in PyTorch, particularly focusing on their performance and statistical properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "We identified that `torch.randperm` is well-suited for generating single permutations without bias but lacks the ability to produce multiple permutations in batch mode. On the other hand, `torch.argsort` with `torch.rand` or `torch.randint` (with either 32-bit or 64-bit integers) can generate multiple permutations in parallel, improving performance on GPUs but introducing potential biases due to duplicate values.\n",
    "\n",
    "By modeling the problem as a binomial distribution and using statistical criteria, in [section 7](#decision-rule) we provided a criterion determining which, if any, PyTorch form for producing random permutations to use.  An important result is that the 64-bit integer call can be used safely in all but the most extreme cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also demonstrated that the simplification $\\sigma_b \\approx \\sigma_f$ is justified given the small values of $d^2$ in our solution space, simplifying the mathematical model without significantly affecting accuracy.  Similarly, we demonstrated that collisions of 3 or more did not occur with the range of interest, with is another condition for model accuracy.\n",
